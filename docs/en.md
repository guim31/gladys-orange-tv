# Orange TV

Control and follow your **Orange TV decoder** (UHD 86, TV 4, TV 5, TV 6) from Gladys, on your local
network: turn it on or put it in standby, see the channel on screen, change channels, raise or lower the
volume, and react in your scenes when the TV is turned on or the channel changes.

The integration uses the local HTTP API of the decoder (port 8080), the one the Orange TV mobile app
uses. No account, no cloud.

> **Developed without the hardware: feedback welcome.** The integration was built and tested against a
> simulator faithful to the answers published by the open source projects that use this API, not
> against a real decoder. Tell us what works and what does not on
> [GitHub](https://github.com/guim31/gladys-orange-tv/issues) or on the Gladys forum.

## Requirements

- An Orange TV decoder connected to your Livebox, on the same network as Gladys.
- Its IP address: in the Livebox interface (`http://192.168.1.1`), under the connected devices. Reserve
  it (static DHCP lease) so it does not change.
- Gladys 5.1.0 or later.

## Configuration

In **Integrations → Orange TV → Configuration**:

- **IP address**: the address of the decoder, e.g. `192.168.1.20` (port 8080 by default; type
  `192.168.1.20:8081` for another one).
- **Name**: the name of the device in Gladys. Empty: "Orange TV" followed by the address.
- Up to three decoders, one per section.
- **Reading interval**: how often the decoders are read, from 5 seconds to 1 minute (10 seconds by
  default). It is the delay before Gladys sees a channel change made with the remote.
- **Language of the names**: language of the feature names and of the texts the integration sends.
  Choose it before adding the devices: Gladys keeps the names given at creation.

**Test the decoders** reads every decoder and says what it shows. Then add the devices from the
**Discovery** tab.

## Devices

One device per decoder, with these features:

| Feature            | What it does                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Power**          | On (1) or standby (0). A decoder that stops answering counts as off. Writable: turns the decoder on or off. |
| **Channel number** | Number of the live channel on the remote, 0 when none. Writable: types the number on the remote.            |
| **Channel**        | Name of the channel, or what the decoder shows: _Home page_, _Video on demand_, _Standby_, _Off_.           |
| **Channel up**     | Button: next channel.                                                                                       |
| **Channel down**   | Button: previous channel.                                                                                   |
| **Volume up**      | Button: one volume step up.                                                                                 |
| **Volume down**    | Button: one volume step down.                                                                               |
| **Mute**           | Button: mute or unmute.                                                                                     |
| **Play / pause**   | Button: pause live TV or a replay, and resume.                                                              |

The power key of the remote is a toggle: the integration reads the decoder first and presses it only
when needed, so "turn off" never turns a decoder on.

The channel names come from a table of the Orange line-up embedded in the integration (free channels,
the main ones up to 40). A channel missing from it shows as `EPG <id>` (its id in the Orange guide),
with number 0.

## Widgets

### Remote

The state of the decoder and the channel on screen, with four buttons: **Turn on** (or **Standby** when
it is on), then either **Channel −**, **Channel +** and **Mute** (default) or **Volume −**,
**Volume +** and **Mute** (setting _Buttons_). Gladys allows four buttons per widget: put two Remote
widgets side by side for the whole remote.

### Favorite channels

Four channel buttons, numbers chosen in the widget settings (TF1, France 2, France 3 and M6 by default).
The channel on screen carries a check mark. A tap on a decoder in standby turns it on first, then types
the number.

## Scene triggers

- **Decoder turned on**: the decoder left standby. Information passed on: decoder name, channel number,
  channel.
- **Decoder turned off**: the decoder went to standby, or stopped answering (filter _How_). Information
  passed on: decoder name, how (`standby` or `unreachable`).
- **Channel changed**: the decoder switched to another live channel (filter on a channel number,
  empty: any). Information passed on: decoder name, channel number and name, previous channel number
  and name. Going through the home page and back to the same channel is not a change; the first channel seen after a start of the integration on the home page or in standby is one, without previous channel.

The events fire even for a decoder not added in Gladys.

## Scene actions

- **Turn the decoder on or off**: presses the power key only when needed. Output: whether the key was
  pressed.
- **Put on a channel**: types the channel number on the remote; turns the decoder on first if it is in
  standby (about 6 seconds). Outputs: channel number and name.
- **Press a remote key**: OK, back, menu, TV guide, arrows, channels, volume, mute, play / pause,
  rewind, fast forward, record, video on demand, power; up to 10 times (volume steps).

Without a decoder chosen, the actions drive the first decoder of the configuration.

## Scene examples

- **Morning news**: at 7:00 on weekdays → _Put on a channel_ 16 (franceinfo).
- **Movie night**: _Decoder turned on_ after 20:00 → dim the living room lights.
- **Quiet house**: _Decoder turned off_ → turn off the TV power strip after 5 minutes.
- **Children**: _Channel changed_ to a given number → send a message.

## Troubleshooting

- **"does not answer (off, or wrong address)"**: check the IP address in the Livebox; the decoder must be
  powered. In deep standby (the energy saving mode of the decoder) it stops answering on the network:
  it then shows as _Off_ and can only be turned on with its remote.
- **"answers, but is not an Orange TV decoder"**: the address is another device's.
- **The channel shows `EPG 1234`**: the channel is not in the embedded table; tell us its number and
  name in an issue.
- **A typed channel is wrong**: the digits are typed 0.35 s apart; tell us if your decoder needs more.
- Logs: **Integrations → Orange TV → Logs**; set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` for every reading.

## Limitations

- Developed without the hardware: the reading of standby, of the home page and of the apps comes from the
  open source projects, not from tests on a real decoder. The Orange "Clé TV" (Android TV) probably has
  no such local API: not supported until someone confirms it does.
- No program guide: the decoder only gives the id of the channel on screen, and the integration does not
  call any Orange online service.
- A decoder in deep standby cannot be woken up from the network.
- No discovery: the IP address is typed in the configuration.
- The local API has no password: anyone on your network can drive the decoder, with or without Gladys.
  The integration only sends keys of the remote.
- Not affiliated with Orange. Orange is a trademark of Orange SA.
